                                Medical tests can help detect a condition, determine a
                                diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working,
                                or monitor the condition over time. A doctor may order these
                                tests as part of a routine checkup, to check for certain
                                diseases and disorders, or to monitor your health.

                                Positive and Negative Tests: <br></br> Positive means whatever
                                the test was looking for was found. Negative means whatever the
